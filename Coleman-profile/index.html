                    <p>I would say my superpower is being resourceful. I am an avid seeker of knowledge and understanding which fuels the ability to be resourceful. One of the areas I seek to acquire more knowledge and understanding in is technology. In the past, I have been more of a self-taught individual, but I have found that while acquiring some knowledge by self-study is good, however, I tend to do even better when structured courses are included. This is one of the reasons I want to take the Web Programming course with Tech901. I have previously taken a course here and enjoy the structure it gives to my learning and growth in the area of technology. I have tried in the past to learn web development/programming on my own but would get sidetracked. I am hoping that I will be accepted into the class and begin my journey into the Software Development track at Tech901 and with the completion of this class I will, for the first time ever, have a completed and active web page.</p>
